# 🌿 Plant Disease Prediction using Environmental Data

## 📌 Problem Statement

Plant diseases, especially fungal infections, are a major cause of crop losses globally. These diseases are often triggered by environmental factors like high humidity, temperature, and rainfall. Early prediction of disease outbreaks enables farmers to take preventive actions, optimize pesticide use, and improve crop yield.

This project leverages a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the likelihood of plant disease based on real-time environmental data.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The synthetic dataset consists of **10,000 samples** simulating diverse environmental conditions across different farm locations. Each sample includes environmental measurements and a binary label indicating plant health.

### 🔑 Features

- `temperature` — Ambient temperature (°C)
- `humidity` — Air humidity (%)
- `rainfall` — Rainfall (mm)
- `soil_pH` — Soil pH value
- `disease_present` — **Target label** (0 = Healthy, 1 = Diseased)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Train a binary classification model using a **Decision Tree** to predict plant disease presence from environmental factors.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier)
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- **Streamlit** (for web UI)

## 📈 Potential Applications

* Smart farming platforms
* Weather-based plant disease alert systems
* Precision agriculture dashboards
